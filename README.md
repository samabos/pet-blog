# Pet Blog Web Application
### Problem Statement 
Xyz corporation runs an online News blog OR platform where users signup to get daily updates or content on different ways to rare pets and tips on to how to make money from pet photography.
When the platform started Users only had one pet case study and the system was designed in such a way that when a user signs up to the platform, they are automatically added to the default channel on pet tips which focuses on Dogs.
But as the platform grew, they had users who wanted to get updates and content about other pets and not just only about Dogs.
To solve this problem Xyz corporation has hired you to refactor the system such that when a user signs up to the platform, instead of being automatically add to the Dog updates channel, users are allowed to first join the platform and then have the liberty to choose the pet updates channel of their choice, and the existing users on the platform are also given the option to join any other preferred channel on the  platform as well. Users can also be in more than one channel depending on their choice.

Task:

- Create a simple signup form to get user details (email, password)
- Create a login page for user to login to the platform
- Have a dashboard screen where user can select their preferred update channel. (Dog updates, Cat updates, Goat updates)
- HelloAllow user join as much update channel as they wish
- Show the list of channel they have joined to them
- Write Unit test to ensure that the user can join multiple channel
- Push your code to a git platform you of your choice and create a pull request to your working branch dev
- Host your app a and send us your app link and GitHub link
